Shows bar charts of daily stock volume for 30 stocks.

## Additional Features
- hovering over a bar chart increases it's size
- the AAPL stock uses 5000 datapoints

Please note I have included an API KEY in a .env file to make sharing easy while still connecting with a third-party API for stock volume data.
